# Breadboard Computer v2

This project is related to building hardware more than a software project.  There will be some code added to this project later on for programming the firmware and downloading a program, but that will be in the final stages.

This project is inspired by [Ben Eater's Breadboard Computer](https://eater.net/8bit).  Currently as this get started, I have his computer nearly complete and I am working on the final connections and debugging before I get into the control logic.

Any original code included in this project is offered under the following license terms:
